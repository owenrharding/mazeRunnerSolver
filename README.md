Maze Runner and Solver in Java

First time using Java!
Not my favourite language but this assignment for CSSE2002 was still really fun.
- Reads a text file (which is representative of a maze) and either prints said maze to the terminal or to a GUI based on command line prompts
- Allows user to solve the maze themselves, checking to see if they've completed it or not
- Maze solver checks if given maze file is completable or not
- User's path is displayed with light blue squares, and backtracking displayed with dark blue
- Was introduced to black box and white box testing, and made a lot of test files including edge testing
- All code is written by me (I'm pretty sure)
